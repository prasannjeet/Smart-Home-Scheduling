### Sample Input and Output

```
Welcome to Smart Home Dynamic Programming Based Scheduling Algorithm

We need following data from you:
	1.	Total Power Levels
	2.	Total Time Intervals
	3.	Based on the above data, value of Alpha (The factor used to multiply energy consumption 
	    to find out total cost) at each time interval
	4.	Based on the above data, energy consumption at each power level

=================================================================================
Please enter the total Power Levels in the system:	4
Now enter the total Time Intervals in the system:	2

Now we will enter the value of alpha for each time interval:
=================================================================================
Enter the value of alpha for time interval [1]	2
Enter the value of alpha for time interval [2]	1

Now we will enter the value of energy consumption for each power level:
=================================================================================
Enter the Energy Consumption for power level [1]	0
Enter the Energy Consumption for power level [2]	1
Enter the Energy Consumption for power level [3]	2
Enter the Energy Consumption for power level [4]	3

=================================================================================
The Solution Is:
(0, 0)
(1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 3)
(4, 5)
(5, 7)
(6, 9)

Process finished with exit code 0
